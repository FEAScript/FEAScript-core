## Heat Conduction in a 2D Fin

This example demonstrates a typical cooling fin scenario. There are two Node.js implementations:

#### i. Standard Version (`heatConduction2DFin.js`)

Basic implementation using the FEAScriptModel class

#### ii. Gmsh Version (`heatConduction2DFinGmsh.js`)

Implementation using an unstructured mesh generated by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) (the mesh file, `rect_quad_unstruct.msh`, is also located in the current directory). 

For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/heat-conduction-2d-fin.html) in the FEAScript website.
