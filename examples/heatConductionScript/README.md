# Heat Conduction Examples

This directory contains Node.js examples demonstrating how to use the FEAScript library to solve steady-state heat conduction problems.

## Examples

#### 1. Heat Conduction Through a Wall

This example demonstrates a heat flow case through a building wall. For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/HeatConduction1DWall.html) in the FEAScript website.

#### 2. Heat Conduction in a 2D Fin

This example demonstrates a typical cooling fin scenario. There are two Node.js implementations:

#### i. Standard Version (`heatConduction2DFin.js`)

Basic implementation using the FEAScriptModel class

#### ii. Gmsh Version (`heatConduction2DFinGmsh.js`)

Implementation using an unstructured mesh generated by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) (the mesh file, `rect_quad_unstruct.msh`, is also located in the current directory). For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/HeatConduction2DFin.html) in the FEAScript website.

## Running the Examples

#### 1. Create package.json with ES module support:

```bash
echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install feascript mathjs
```

#### 3. Run the example:

```bash
node HeatConduction1DWall.js
```

(for the "Heat Conduction Through a Wall" case)
