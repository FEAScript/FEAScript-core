# Heat Conduction Examples

This directory contains Node.js examples demonstrating how to use the FEAScript library to solve steady-state heat conduction problems.

## Examples

#### 1. Heat Conduction in a 1D Wall (`heatConduction1DWall.js`)

This example demonstrates a heat flow case through a building wall.

For detailed information on the model setup, refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/heat-conduction-1d-wall.html) in the FEAScript website.

#### 2. Heat Conduction in a 2D Fin (Standard Mesh) (`heatConduction2DFin.js`)

Basic implementation using an internally generated structured mesh.

#### 3. Heat Conduction in a 2D Fin (Gmsh Mesh) (`heatConduction2DFinGmsh.js`)

Implementation using an unstructured mesh generated by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) (the mesh file, `rect_quad_unstruct.msh`, is also located in the current directory).

For detailed information on the model setup, refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/heat-conduction-2d-fin.html) in the FEAScript website.

#### 4. Heat Conduction in a 2D Rhomboid Fin (Gmsh Mesh) (`heatConduction2DRhomFinGmsh.js`)

Implementation using a Gmsh-generated mesh for a rhomboid domain (the mesh file, `rhom_quad.msh`, is also located in the current directory).

For detailed information on the model setup, refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/heat-conduction-2d-rhom-fin-gmsh.html) in the FEAScript website.

## Running the Examples

#### 1. Create package.json with ES module support:

```bash
echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install feascript mathjs
```

#### 3. Run an example:

```bash
node heatConduction2DFin.js
```

(or `node heatConduction2DFinGmsh.js` / `node heatConduction2DRhomFinGmsh.js`)
