# Front Propagation Examples

This directory contains Node.js examples demonstrating how to use the FEAScript library to solve front propagation problems using the eikonal equation.

## Examples

#### 1. Solidification Front Propagation in a 2D Domain (solidificationFront2D)

This example demonstrates solving an eikonal equation in a 2D domain to track the movement of a solidification interface. For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/solidification-front-2d.html) in the FEAScript website.

## Running the Examples

#### 1. Create package.json with ES module support:

```bash
echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install feascript mathjs
```

#### 3. Run the example:

```bash
node SolidificationFront2D.js
```
