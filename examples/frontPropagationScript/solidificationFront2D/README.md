## Solidification Front Propagation in a 2D Domain

This example demonstrates solving an eikonal equation in a 2D domain to track the movement of a solidification interface. For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/solidification-front-2d.html) in the FEAScript website.
