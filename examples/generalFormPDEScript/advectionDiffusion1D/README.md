## Advection-Diffusion with Gaussian Source

This example demonstrates solving a one-dimensional advection-diffusion problem with a Gaussian source term. The problem models the transport of a substance under the effects of both diffusion and advection. For detailed information on the model setup refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/advection-diffusion-1d.html) in the FEAScript website.
