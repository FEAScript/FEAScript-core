## Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 2D rectangular domain using the FEAScript library. The problem represents a typical cooling fin scenario, where the objective is to model heat conduction and understand temperature distribution under specific boundary conditions.

### Available Versions

This example is available in two Node.js implementations:

1. **Standard Version** (`HeatConduction2DFin.js`) - Basic implementation using the FEAScriptModel class
2. **Gmsh Version** (`HeatConduction2DFinGmsh.js`) - Implementation using an unstructured mesh generated by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) (the mesh file, `rect_quad_unstruct.msh`, is also located in the current directory)

### Instructions

The examples require the `feascript` npm package and its peer dependencies (`mathjs`). They import FEAScript directly from the npm package and run the simulations in a Node.js environment, making them suitable for server-side applications or local development without a browser (no WEB APIs here). To run the examples, follow these instructions:

1. **Create package.json with ES module support:**

   ```bash
   echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install feascript mathjs
   ```

3. **Run the desired version:**

   ```bash
   node HeatConduction2DFin.js
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   node HeatConduction2DFinGmsh.js
   ```

**Note:** For detailed information on the model setup, boundary conditions, and simulation results, refer to the comments in the JavaScript files and the corresponding standard [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/HeatConduction2DFin.html) as well as to the Gmsh mesh [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/HeatConduction2DFinGmsh.html).
