## Heat Conduction Through a Wall

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 1D domain using the FEAScript library. The problem represents heat flow through a building wall, where heat conduction is modeled to determine temperature profiles under specific boundary conditions.

All examples are intentionally kept simple and modular to facilitate easy integration with web applications. The clean, minimal structure makes it straightforward to incorporate these simulations into existing websites or web-based tools.
